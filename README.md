# dnd-app
This is a simple website designed to help my friends and I play Dungeons and Dragons. As such, it's tailored
to very specific recurring questions we encounter while
playing.

This uses simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that the 
website can be deployed on Neocities. You can see the live version of the application [here](link.com).

## Using This Website
This is a simple website, so simply opening the `index.html` will allow you to begin using the website locally. You can use a wide variety of services to deploy the webiste (like Neocities, or if you want to get fanicer something like Vercel).
